# BullsAndCowsGame
Classic Bulls and Cows game with computer logic

I made this game for a contest in the past. The user is competing against 2 different computer algorithms. The goal is to guess a random 4-digit number (with non-repeating digits) in as minimum number of guesses as possible.

The second algoirthm is very effective. Can You beat it?
